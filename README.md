Dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nirmalsankalana/fashion-product-text-images-dataset

I tried uploading embedding array values, but it was too big if you run the code by uncommenting some parts it should work(I don't use github often)

This code is my implementation of the novel modular approach using SBERT(for clustering) for text and ViT for images.
